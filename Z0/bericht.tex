\section{Introduction}



\section{Theoretical Background}

In the following chapter a brief overview of the knowledge needed to perform the lab experiment will be presented.

\subsection{Standard Model of Elementary Particle Physics}

The Standard Model describes the elementary particles and their interactions, excluding gravitation.
In the Standard Model particles can be grouped by their properties into quarks, leptons and interaction particles.
While quarks and leptons are fermions, the interaction particles are (gauge) bosons.
Quarks have fractional charge of $+2/3$ or $-1/3$ and leptons are either charged (with charge $\pm1$ for electron, muon and tau) or uncharged (neutrinos).
Interaction particles can also be charged (W~boson) or uncharged (photon, gluon, Z~boson).

\end{figure}

\subsection{Heavy Vector Boson Z$^0$}

The particle of interest for this experiment is the Z~boson \korr{dessen} decays are studied.
The Z~boson has a mass of \SI{91.2}{GeV} and a decay width of \SI{2.5}{GeV}.
It was discovered in 1983 in collider experiments at CERN.

\subsubsection{Decays of Z$^0$}

Z~bosons can decay in many different ways.
The final state of their decays can contain quarks, charged leptons and neutrinos, although it must be noted, that the top quark can not be produced since it is way heavier than the Z~boson.
Due to conservation laws the Z~boson may produce only pairs of particles and antiparticles (e.g. electron and positron or neutrino and corresponding antineutrino).
In case of production of a quark-antiquark pair the final state particles will form jets.
Because of confinement in QCD the strong interaction becomes stronger for larger distances between two strongly interacting particles.
If quark and antiquark fly apart a QCD field with high energy is created between them, where additional quark-antiquark pairs can be produced.
This process repeats itself as long as the particles have more energy than needed for formation of colourless hadrons.
As a result a hadronic decay of Z~bosons leads to a high number of final state particles, called jets.
Possible Feynman diagrams for the mentioned processes are shown in figure \korr{REF}.

\subsubsection{Forward-Backward Asymmetry A$_\mathrm{FB}$}

In a $e^+e^- \rightarrow f\bar{f}$ reaction the differential cross section of the produced fermions is different for the forward and backward hemispheres.
Those are defined by the angle $\theta$ between incoming positron and outgoing positively charged particle.
In this lab experiment, the asymmetry A$_\mathrm{FB}$ is measured in $e^+e^- \rightarrow \mu^+\mu^-$ events.

\subsection{The OPAL Experiment}

The OPAL~detector was used from 1989 to 2000 at the LEP storage ring at the CERN facility in Switzerland.
It was designed to detect all kinds of particles produced in collisions of electrons and positrons.
To cover most of the solid angle it had a barrel-like structure and consisted of a cylinder and two endcaps.
For tracking and vertex reconstruction purposes the inner part is formed by a semiconductor strip detector and multiple proportional chambers.
To measure the momentum of charged particles, the whole inner detector is surrounded by a solenoid which created a magnetic field.
The solenoid is followed by the calorimeters, first the electromagnetic and after that the hadronic one.
As a last layer muon chambers are installed which consist of a tracking detector themselves.

\section{Part I: Analysis of Event Displays}

On the first day the software \texttt{GROPE} was used to study event displays and detector responses of the OPAL detector.

\subsection{Part I: Analysis of Event Displays}

To learn how to distinguish the different decay channels of the Z boson test samples with events with only one decay mode have been investigated.
In the following part the measured properties of the observed events and exemplary pictures of the detector response are presented.
\clearpage
\subsubsection{Z$^0\rightarrow e^+e^-$}

A decay into electrons can easily be identified by the energy deposited in the electromagnetic calorimeters.
The final state particles are flying approximately in opposite direction and are ideally completely stopped in the calorimeter.
A track for every particle can be observed in the tracking chamber.
Additional hits in the electromagnetic calorimeters probably occur due to bremsstrahlung photons which leave no track in the inner detector.

\end{figure}
\clearpage
\subsubsection{Z$^0\rightarrow \mu^+\mu^-$}

Muons are detected in the muon chambers which form the outermost part of the detector.
Since all other particles (except the non-detectable neutrinos) are stopped before reaching the muon chamber a signal there can -- neglecting noise hits -- be identified as a muon. 
In general, muons are also created in a back to back configuration and leave a track in the tracking detector.

They are identified as muons in the muon detector (red arrow).}
\end{figure}
\clearpage
\subsubsection{Z$^0\rightarrow \tau^+\tau^-$}

Because of the short lifetime of the $\tau$ lepton it can not be detected directly but by its decay products.
Because it can decay in both leptons and hadrons there are two possible types of detector responses.
In a leptonic $\tau$ decay an electron or muon and two neutrinos are created and seen as charged tracks in the inner detector.
They cause signals either in the electromagnetic calorimeter or in the muon chambers while the neutrinos are not detected.

In a hadronic $\tau$ decay a neutrino and hadrons are produced.
All hadrons create a shower in the hadronic calorimeter but depending on their charge a track can not always be observed.

The 1-prong event can be identified as a muon while the 3-prong consists of pions which are detected in the electromagnetic calorimeter (in case of $\pi^0$) and the hadronic calorimeter ($\pi^\pm$).}
\end{figure}
\clearpage
\subsubsection{Z$^0\rightarrow q\bar{q}$}

Decays of Z$^0$ into quark-antiquark pairs always produce jets where quarks hadronize to mesons or baryons.
Those can be identified as a large number of charged tracks in the tracking system.
In addition some of the hadrons decay into leptons which can be seen as signal in the electromagnetic calorimeter or the muon chambers.
The hadrons are stopped and seen as showers in the hadronic calorimeter.

\end{figure}
\clearpage

\subsubsection{Event Identification in Test Sample}

Based on the observations from the previous exercise it was possible to evaluate cuts to apply on the data in order to distinguish between different decay channels of the Z boson.
Those are given by the parameters measured or reconstructed in the detector, namely the number of charged tracks (\texttt{ncharged}), the scalar sum of all momenta of charged tracks (\texttt{pcharged}) and the total energy deposited in the electromagnetic or hadronic calorimeter (\texttt{E\_ECAL} or \texttt{E\_HCAL} respectively).

In order to get optimal cut criteria, the data from all Monte-Carlo simulated samples has been histogrammed which is shown in figure \korr{REF}.
The used cuts are given in table \ref{tab:cut_criteria_day1} and can be reviewed by looking on the events in a test sample.
All of the decay channels found with the cut criteria could be verified by analysis of event displays.

\clearpage
\section{Part II: Statistical Analysis of $\mathrm{Z}^0$ Decays}
The second part of this laboratory experiment is concerned with the analysis of data gathered by the OPAL-detector at LEP.
Since an analysis using event displays is infeasible, the data analysis software \texttt{PAW} is used instead.
The aim of this part is to determine the mass and (partial) decay width of the $\mathrm{Z}^0$ and in addition to this calculate the mixing~$\sin^2\theta_\mathrm{W}$ from the forward-backward asymmetry in the muon channel.

\subsection{Analysis of Monte-Carlo Data}
\label{sec:analysis_mc_data}
Before the data taken at the OPAL-detector can be evaluated, four datasets of Monte-Carlo data are analyzed to refine the preliminary cuts that were determined in the previous part.
These datasets contain a selection of simulated $\mathrm{Z}^0$ decays, which are separated into the different decay channels with electron, muon, tau or hadronic final states.
Since the number of simulated events is known, these datasets can be used to estimate the (mis-)identification probability of our final cuts.
The nomenclature that is used in describing the detector data is summarized in table~\ref{tab:desc_variables}.

\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
	\begin{tabularx}{0.9\textwidth}{lX}
		\toprule
		\textbf{Variable} & \textbf{Description} \\
		\midrule		
		\texttt{ncharged} & Number of charged particle tracks in the tracking detector \\
		\texttt{pcharged} & Total momentum of all charged particle tracks in the tracking detector \\
		\texttt{e\_ecal} & Total energy deposited in the electromagnetic calorimeter \\
		\texttt{e\_hcal} & Total energy deposited in the hadronic calorimeter \\
		\texttt{cos\_thet} & Angle between the incoming positron and outgoing positively charged particle (undefined if the number of positively charged particles in the final state is not equal to one) \\
		\texttt{e\_lep} & Beam energy at LEP \\
		\bottomrule
	\end{tabularx}
	\caption{Description of the variables in the $\mathrm{Z}^0$ decay datasets. Momenta and energies are always given in units of GeV.}
	\label{tab:desc_variables}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Acceptance of the OPAL-Detector}
\label{sec:acceptance_detector}
To get accustomed to the data analysis software, the distributions of a number of variables in the MC-datasets were plotted as histograms.
One such variable is the sum of the charged particle momenta, which is depicted in figure \ref{fig:uncut_pcharged}.
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{./data/tag2/uncut/cropped/pcharged_uncut.pdf}
	\caption{Distribution of \texttt{pcharged} for the Monte-Carlo simulations of electron (upper left), muon (upper right), tau (lower left) and hadronic final states (lower right). The momenta are given in units of GeV.}
	\label{fig:uncut_pcharged}
\end{figure}
A notable feature of these distributions is the high number of events with vanishing \texttt{pcharged} for the electron and muon channel, which shall be analyzed further.
To investigate this occurrence additional cuts on other variables were performed, which lead to the observation that these events stem from particles that have been detected at very small angles with respect to the beam axis.
Since the detector cannot properly detect particles close to the beam axis, a cut on \texttt{cos\_thet} should decrease the number events with vanishing \texttt{pcharged}.
Therefore the cut
\begin{align*}
	\left| \cos\theta \right| < 0.9
\end{align*}
was chosen, which removed almost all events with vanishing \texttt{pcharged} in both channels.


\subsubsection{Refining the Cuts for Event Selection}
In order to optimize the cuts for event identification various variables of the simulated datasets have been plotted to allow for the determination of cut criteria to allow for the distinction of different decay channels of the Z-boson.
The histograms of the variables are depicted in appendix \ref{app:uncut_mc}.

Based on the observed distributions cuts on the parameters have been set, such that specific decay channels are filtered out of the datasets.
The cuts are chosen in a way, that a high number of events are retained while separating the different decay channels.
Nevertheless an optimal separation is not possible without discarding a high number of events, thus leading to diminished statistics.
Therefore in section~\ref{sec:efficiency_matrix} the number of misidentifications in the different decay channels is evaluated, leading to the formulation of a efficiency matrix.
Moreover in section~\ref{sec:s_t_channel_separation} additional cuts to the electron channel determined to separate $s$- and $t$-channel.
An overview of the selection cuts is given in table~\ref{tab:cut_criteria}, which were chosen according to the distribution of the various decay channels depicted in appendix~\ref{app:uncut_mc}.
\begin{table}[h]
	\centering
	\input{./tables/cuts}
	\caption{Selection cuts for filtering of specific decay channels. A differentiation of $s$- and $t$-channel for the electron-channel is discussed in section~\ref{sec:s_t_channel_separation}.}
	\label{tab:cut_criteria}
\end{table}

\noindent In the following a short reasoning for the chosen cuts is given:
\begin{description}
	\item[Electron-channel] A cut in the number of charged particles is used to separate the electron from the hadron channel.
	Moreover a high energy deposition in the electromagnetic calorimeter is observed, so that a lower bound on the deposited energy leads to a good separation of the muon- and tau-channels.
	Finally additional cuts to the deposited energy in the hadronic calorimeter and the sum of charged particle momenta are applied, which further separate electrons from tau final-states.
	
	\item[Muon-channel] Again a cut in the number of charged particles separates the muon cleanly from the hadron-channel.
	An upper bound on the energy deposit in the electromagnetic calorimeter isolates it from the electron-channel and leads to some separation from the tau-channel.
	The cut on the sum of charged particle momenta leads to a clean separation from the tau-channel.	
	
	\item[Tau-channel] Again this channel is separated from the hadronic channel by the cut on \texttt{ncharged}.
	Moreover some separation of the electron and muon-channels is done by cutting on \texttt{e\_ecal} and \texttt{pcharged}.
	However the tau-channel is difficult to isolate from the remaining channels.
	Therefore a (relatively) high probability of misidentification of tau-events is expected.
	Quantitatively this is examined in section~\ref{sec:efficiency_matrix}. 
	
	\item[Hadron-channel] This channel is quite cleanly isolated by cutting on the number of charged particles due to the hadronization process.
	Nevertheless some misidentified tau-events can be expected.
\end{description}
In addition to these selection cuts the electron and muon-channels are cut in \texttt{cos\_thet} to remove non-reconstructible events close to the beam axis (according to section \ref{sec:acceptance_detector}).

\subsubsection{Separating $s$- and $t$-Channel in $\mathrm{e}^+ + \mathrm{e}^- \rightarrow \mathrm{e}^+ + \mathrm{e}^-$ Events}
\label{sec:s_t_channel_separation}
In section \korr{REF Vorbereitungsaufgaben} it was determined the differential cross section of the scattering process ($t$-channel) is strongly peaked in the forward direction.
This process only contributes marginally to the total differential cross section of $t$- and $s$-channel in the backward direction.
Therefore by constraining the scattering angle to larger values a selection of the annihilation process can be performed.
For the case of annihilation the contribution of the intermediate Z-boson to the cross section is dominant, at center of mass energies comparable to the Z-mass.

The angular distribution in the electron-channel is depicted in appendix~\ref{fig:cos_theta_uncut}, where one can clearly see the peak in the forward direction due to $t$-channel events.
To select the $s$-channel processes an upper bound on \texttt{cos\_thet} (scattering angle) is chosen, such that the angular distribution is mirror-symmetric with respect to $\cos\theta = 0$, reflecting the approximate\footnote{The forward-backward asymmetry is small compared to the asymmetry introduced by the $t$-channel process.} forward-backward symmetry of the $s$-channel process.

As the upper limit $\cos\theta < 0.5$ was chosen resulting in the angular distribution shown in figure~\ref{fig:t_cut_distribution}.
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{./data/tag2/angular_mc/cropped/t_channel_cut.pdf}
	\caption{Angular distribution of the scattering angle in the electron-channel after separating $s$- and $t$-channel.}
	\label{fig:t_cut_distribution}
\end{figure}
In hindsight the chosen upper limit on the scattering angle was set too high, since the mirror-symmetry is clearly broken.
Therefore it is expected that there is a significant $t$-channel contribution in the final cuts, leading to a distortion of the measured resonance curve.

In addition to this the cut in the scattering angle leads to a significant loss of $s$-channel events in the forward direction.
Moreover the cut $\left| \cos\theta \right| < 0.9$ made in section~\ref{sec:acceptance_detector} also leads to some losses close to the beam pipe in the backward direction.
To correct for these losses one can consider that the differential cross-section of the $s$-channel process is given by
\begin{align*}
	\deriv{\sigma_\mathrm{s}}{\cos\theta} \propto \left( 1 + \cos\theta \right)
\end{align*}
thus the correction due to the cut on the scattering angle can be calculated by integration leading to
\begin{align*}
\kappa_\mathrm{angular} = \frac{\int_{-1}^{1}(1 + \cos^2\theta) \dinf{\cos\theta}}{\int_{-0.9}^{0.5}(1 + \cos^2\theta) \dinf{\cos\theta}} \approx 1.5829 \text{.}
\end{align*}
For the upcoming determination of the efficiency matrix it is important to know the total number of $s$-channel events in the MC-dataset, which contains $s$ as well as $t$-channel events.
Therefore one has to consider the total number of \num{100000} simulated events in the electron-channel ($s$- and $t$-channel) was reduced by a precut to \num{93454} events, discarding events that cannot be reconstructed.
Since the details of the precut are not known, it is assumed that it affects the $s$- and $t$-channel equally.
Thus the total number of annihilation events in the dataset can be calculated using
\begin{align*}
	N_\mathrm{e,\,s} = n_\mathrm{e,\,s} \cdot \frac{100000}{93454} \cdot \kappa_\mathrm{angular}
\end{align*}
with the number of $s$-channel events $n_\mathrm{e,\,s}$ after the cuts previously described.
Using the values in table~\ref{tab:num_events} the total number of $s$-channel events in the MC-dataset can be estimated to be
\begin{align*}
	N_\mathrm{e,\,s} = 34136
\end{align*}
which is used in section~\ref{sec:efficiency_matrix} to determine the efficiency matrix.

\begin{table}[h]
	\centering
	\input{./tables/events.tex}
	\caption{Number of events in the various decay channels after applying the selection cuts described the previous sections on the MC-datasets. The plots for determining these values can be found in appendix~\ref{app:mc_final_cut}.}
	\label{tab:num_events}
\end{table}

\begin{description}
	\item[Remark] Applying the cut condition on a total of $N$ entries leads to $N$ binary decisions, whether the entry fulfills the cut or does not.
	Therefore the underlying statistical description is the binomial distribution, for which the standard deviation can be estimated by
	\begin{align*}
		\Delta n_i = \sqrt{N \cdot \left[ \frac{n_i}{N} - \left( \frac{n_i}{N} \right)^2 \right]} \quad \text{with}\quad i \in \{ \mathrm{e}, \mathrm{\mu}, \mathrm{\tau}, \mathrm{q} \} \,\text{,}
	\end{align*}
	where $n_i$ describes the number of events after cut $i$ and $N$ the total number of events.
	Therefore it is assumed that the standard deviations of event counts after cutting the data can be estimated by this statistic.
\end{description}


\subsubsection{Efficiency Matrix}
\label{sec:efficiency_matrix}
By setting cuts on the data one loses a fraction of the simulated events and in addition to this misidentification of events can occur.
Knowing that each datasets was simulated with \num{100000} events (or for the electron-channel the total number of events in the $s$-channel as determined in section~\ref{sec:s_t_channel_separation}) the efficiency of the event selection using cuts can be evaluated.
For this a matrix formalism is employed, which connects the number of events in the different decay channels (as determined by the cut selection) $\vec{n}$ with the number of events per channel in the underlying data $\vec{N}$.
This relation is described by the so called efficiency matrix~$E$
\begin{align*}
	E = \begin{pmatrix}
		E_{\mathrm{e e}} & E_{\mathrm{e \mu}} & E_{\mathrm{e \tau}} & E_{\mathrm{e q}} \\
		E_{\mathrm{\mu e}} & E_{\mathrm{\mu \mu}} & E_{\mathrm{\mu \tau}} & E_{\mathrm{\mu q}} \\
		E_{\mathrm{\tau e}} & E_{\mathrm{\tau \mu}} & E_{\mathrm{\tau \tau}} & E_{\mathrm{\tau q}} \\
		E_{\mathrm{q e}} & E_{\mathrm{q \mu}} & E_{\mathrm{q \tau}} & E_{\mathrm{q q}} \\
	\end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}
with matrix elements $E_{ij}$, which are defined by
\begin{align}
	E_{ij} = \frac{n_{ij}}{N_j} \quad \text{with} \quad i,j \in \{ \mathrm{e}, \mathrm{\mu}, \mathrm{\tau}, \mathrm{q} \}
	\label{eq:efficiency_matrix_elements}
\end{align}
with $n_{ij}$ the number of particles of type $j$ that were identified by the cut selection to be of type $i$ and the total number of simulated events of this type $N_j$.
According to this formalism the vector of identified particles $\vec{n} = (n_\mathrm{e}, n_\mathrm{\mu}, n_\mathrm{\tau}, n_\mathrm{q})^\mathrm{T}$ can be calculated from the efficiency matrix~$E$ and the vector containing the simulated events $\vec{N} = (N_\mathrm{e}, N_\mathrm{\mu}, N_\mathrm{\tau}, N_\mathrm{q})^\mathrm{T}$ by matrix multiplication
\begin{align}
	\vec{n} = E \cdot \vec{N} \,\text{.}
	\label{eq:efficiency_definition}
\end{align}
For ideal cuts the efficiency matrix would be the unit matrix, since the off-diagonal elements correspond to misidentification of the decay channel and the diagonal elements give the fraction of correctly identified events.

For real data the number of events in the different channels $\vec{N}$ is generally not known, but the different cuts can be applied to the data to obtain the vector of identified particles $\vec{n}$.
Then the number of events $\vec{N}$ in the different decay channels can be inferred from $\vec{n}$ using the inverse of equation \eqref{eq:efficiency_definition}
\begin{align}
	\vec{N} = E^{-1} \cdot \vec{n}
	\label{eq:efficiency_correction}
\end{align}
with the inverted efficiency matrix $E^{-1}$.

To calculate the efficiency matrix according to equation \eqref{eq:efficiency_matrix_elements} one has to note that $N_\mathrm{e}$ is not \num{100000} but rather the number of events in the s-channel as determined in section~\ref{sec:s_t_channel_separation}.
Using the number of events after the different cuts in table~\ref{tab:num_events} the matrix elements of the efficiency matrix can be calculated
\begin{align*}
	&E = \begin{pmatrix}
	0.59259 & 0.00001 & 0.00117 & 0.00000 \\
	0.00000 & 0.78537 & 0.00549 & 0.00000 \\
	0.02027 & 0.04089 & 0.76651 & 0.00934 \\
	0.00018 & 0.00000 & 0.00503 & 0.97533 \\
	\end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}
and the errors are calculated by first order error propagation using the standard deviation as estimated by the underlying binomial distribution for the number of events after cutting
\begin{align*}
	&\Delta E = \begin{pmatrix}
	0.00266 & 0.00000 & 0.00000 & 0.00000 \\
	0.00000 & 0.00130 & 0.00024 & 0.00000 \\
	0.00077 & 0.00063 & 0.00134 & 0.00031 \\
	0.00008 & 0.00000 & 0.00023 & 0.00050 \\
	\end{pmatrix} \,\text{.}
\end{align*}
The off-diagonal elements of this matrix are almost zero meaning that the probability of misidentification is small.
The largest off-diagonal elements with misidentification probabilities of the order of $1 \%$ are the elements for tau-events misidentified as either electron- or muon-events.
This is because separating tau-events from those channels is rather difficult as was mentioned previously.
Moreover the diagonal elements give the fraction of correctly identified events.
Due to the clear signature of hadronic events almost $100 \%$ of events are identified correctly.
For the muon- and tau-channel larger losses of the order of $20 \%$ are observed.
The smallest efficiency of $60 \%$ is observed for the electron-channel due to the high number of discarded events caused by the angular cuts.

For the further analysis the efficiency matrix has to be inverted.
Since the analytical error propagation in the process of inverting this matrix is rather complicated, a Monte-Carlo approach was used instead.
For this a random sample of $\num{100000}$ different efficiency matrices was generated according to the standard deviations given in the error matrix.
The sampled matrices can then be inverted using a numerical algorithm and a sample of $\num{100000}$ inverted efficiency matrices is generated.
From the samples of the inverse matrix the error of the matrix elements can be estimated by the sample standard deviation.
Finally the resulting inverted matrix is given by
\begin{align*}
&E^{-1} = \begin{pmatrix}
	1.68758 & 0.00011 &-0.00258 & 0.00002 \\
	0.00312 & 1.27376 &-0.00912 & 0.00009 \\
   -0.04465 &-0.06796 & 1.30525 &-0.01250 \\
   -0.00007 & 0.00035 &-0.00673 & 1.02536 \\
\end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}
with the error matrix by Monte-Carlo error propagation
\begin{align*}
&\Delta E^{-1} = \begin{pmatrix}
	0.00756 & 0.00001 & 0.00002 & 0.00001 \\
	0.00002 & 0.00211 & 0.00039 & 0.00001 \\
	0.00170 & 0.00105 & 0.00227 & 0.00041 \\
	0.00013 & 0.00002 & 0.00030 & 0.00052 \\
\end{pmatrix} \,\text{.}
\end{align*}
In the following this matrix can be used in analyzing real data gathered at OPAL.

\subsection{Analysis of OPAL-Data}
After the analysis of the cuts for event selection was performed, the data measured at the OPAL-detector can be analyzed.
Of the available datasets \texttt{data6} was chosen, since it has the highest integrated luminosities and therefore should allow for better statistics.

The dataset contains events at seven different center of mass energies at LEP surrounding the Z-resonance.
Therefore in a first step the measurement at different energies have to be separated by a cut in \texttt{e\_lep}.
In the following only the mean value of the center of mass energy is denoted, since the energies vary only slightly from this value.

\subsubsection{Determination of the Cross Section}
\label{sec:determination_cross_section}
After the energies have been separated the selection cuts can be applied to the samples at different energies $\sqrt{s}$.
From these the remaining number of particles $n_i$ with $i \in \{ \mathrm{e}, \mathrm{\mu}, \mathrm{\tau}, \mathrm{q} \}$ can be obtained.
The number of events after the cuts is summarized in table \ref{tab:counts_cross_section}.
To obtain the total number of events of a specific type one has to correct for the efficiency of the cut selection.
This is simply done by matrix multiplication of the inverse efficiency matrix $E^{-1}$ as in equation \eqref{eq:efficiency_correction} with the vector $\vec{n}$.
The error of the correction counts can be calculated using first order error propagation:
\begin{align}
&\Delta N_i = \sqrt{\sum_k \left[ n_k^2 \cdot \left(\Delta E^{-1}\right)_{ik}^2 + \left(E^{-1}\right)_{ik}^2 \cdot \Delta n_k^2 \right]} \,\text{.}
\label{eq:error_prop_matrix_mult}
\end{align}
The efficiency corrected number of events are summarized in table \ref{tab:counts_cross_section_corr}.

\begin{table}
	\begin{subtable}{1.0\textwidth}
		\centering
		\input{./tables/cross_section_counts.tex}
		\subcaption{Number of events at the specified center of mass energy $\sqrt{s}$ after applying the cut selection. The error is estimated from binomial statistics.}
		\label{tab:counts_cross_section}
	\end{subtable}
	
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	
	\begin{subtable}{1.0\textwidth}
		\centering
		\input{./tables/cross_section_counts_corr.tex}
		\subcaption{Total number of events after correction for the efficiency of the cut selection. The error is estimated by first order error propagation as given in equation \eqref{eq:error_prop_matrix_mult}.}
		\label{tab:counts_cross_section_corr}
	\end{subtable}
	\caption{Number of events at center of mass energies $\sqrt{s}$ near the Z-resonance given by the selection cuts determined in section \ref{sec:analysis_mc_data}.}
\end{table}

After the total number of events has been determined, the cross section can be calculated at the different center of mass energies.
For this the relation
\begin{align*}
	N_i = \sigma_i \cdot \int \mathcal{L} \dinf{t}
\end{align*}
can be used to determine the cross section from the number of events at a specific energy and the integrated luminosity in the specified energy interval.
This can be solved for the cross section thus obtaining
\begin{align*}
	\sigma_i = \frac{N_i}{\int \mathcal{L} \dinf{t}} \, \text{.}
\end{align*}
Moreover radiation corrections to the cross section are necessary, so that the cross section can be calculated by
\begin{align*}
	\sigma_i = \frac{N_i}{\int \mathcal{L} \dinf{t}} + \mathrm{corr}_i(\sqrt{s}) \,\text{.}
\end{align*}
Using the integrated luminosities for the given dataset (\texttt{data6}) and the radiation correction summarized in table~\ref{tab:lumi_corr} the cross sections can be calculated.
\begin{table}[h]
	\centering
	\input{./tables/luminosities_radcorr.tex}
	\caption{Integrated luminosities at LEP for the given center of mass energy from \cite{anleitung} and radiation correction to the cross section as given in \cite{instructions}.}
	\label{tab:lumi_corr}
\end{table}
The calculated cross sections at the specified center of mass energies are summarized in table~\ref{tab:cross_sections} using first order error propagation.
\begin{table}[h]
	\centering
	\input{./tables/cross_section.tex}
	\caption{Calculated cross sections of the different decay channels using the measured number of events in table~\ref{tab:counts_cross_section_corr} and the integrated luminosities as well as radiation corrections given in table~\ref{tab:lumi_corr}.

	\label{tab:cross_sections}
\end{table}
These results are discussed in detail in the upcoming sections.

\subsubsection{Determination of the Forward-Backward Asymmetry using Muons}
The Weinberg angle can be determined from the forward-backward asymmetry of the decay $\mathrm{Z}^0 \rightarrow \mu^- \mu^+$, that is the asymmetry in the number of positively charged muons in the forward direction $n_\mathrm{F}$ compared to positively charged muons in the backward direction $n_\mathrm{B}$.
The asymmetry can be calculated using
\begin{align*}
	A_\mathrm{FB} = \frac{n_\mathrm{F} - n_\mathrm{B}}{n_\mathrm{F} + n_\mathrm{B}} + \mathrm{corr}(\sqrt{s})
\end{align*}
including a radiation correction $\mathrm{corr}(\sqrt{s})$.
For calculating the forward-backward asymmetry no efficiency correction has to be performed, since the correction cancels in the resulting expression.
Using the previously determined cut for muon-event selection the forward-backward asymmetry can be measured using the additional cuts 
\begin{align*}
	&\cos\theta > 0 \quad \text{(forward direction)} \\
	&\cos\theta < 0 \quad \text{(backward direction)}
\end{align*}
thus obtaining $n_\mathrm{F}$ or $n_\mathrm{B}$ respectively.
In table \ref{tab:afb} the number of events in forward/backward direction, as well as the calculated forward-backward asymmetry $A_\mathrm{FB}$ have been summarized.
\begin{table}[h]
	\centering
	\input{./tables/afb.tex}
	\caption{Number of events in the forward $n_\mathrm{F}$ and backward direction $n_\mathrm{B}$, radiation correction to the forward-backward asymmetry $\mathrm{corr}(\sqrt{s})$ as given in \cite{anleitung} and the corrected forward-backward asymmetry $A_\mathrm{FB}$.}
	\label{tab:afb}
\end{table}

According to the approximation of the forward-backward asymmetry at the resonance peak
\begin{align*}
	A_\mathrm{FB}^\mathrm{peak} \approx 3 \left( \frac{v_\ell}{a_\ell} \right)^2 = 3 \left( 1 - 4 \sin^2\theta_\mathrm{W} \right)
\end{align*}
which can be approximated by the measured value at $\sqrt{s} = \SI{91.24}{GeV}$
\begin{align*}
	A_\mathrm{FB}^\mathrm{peak} \approx \num{0.0119 +- 0.0075}
\end{align*}
Then the Weinberg angle $\sin^2\theta_\mathrm{W}$ can be calculated using
\begin{align*}
	\sin^2\theta_\mathrm{W} = \frac{1 - \sqrt{A_\mathrm{FB}^\mathrm{peak} / 3}}{4}
\end{align*}

Using the measured value for $A_\mathrm{FB}$ at the peak of the resonance the Weinberg angle is estimated to be
\begin{align*}
	\sin^2\theta_\mathrm{W} = \num{0.234 +- 0.005}
\end{align*}
with the error from gaussian error propagation.
This value is in good agreement with the literature value of
\begin{align*}
	(\sin^2\theta_\mathrm{W})^\mathrm{PDG} = \num{0.23126(5)}
\end{align*}


\subsubsection{Fitting Resonance Curves}
\label{sec:fit_resonance}
From the determined cross section in section \ref{sec:determination_cross_section} various quantities can be extracted by fitting a resonance curve.
The resonance can be described by a Breit-Wigner resonance
\begin{align*}
	\sigma(E_\mathrm{cm}; A, M_\mathrm{Z}, \Gamma_\mathrm{Z}) = \frac{A}{2\pi} \frac{\Gamma_\mathrm{Z}}{(E_\mathrm{cm} - M_\mathrm{Z})^2 + \Gamma_\mathrm{Z}^2 / 4}
\end{align*}
By fitting such a resonance curve to the measured cross sections a number of parameters can be extracted namely the mass of the Z-Boson $M_\mathrm{Z}$, the total decay width $\Gamma_\mathrm{Z}$ and the cross section at peak
\begin{align*}
	\sigma^\mathrm{peak} = \frac{2A}{\pi \Gamma_\mathrm{Z}}
\end{align*}
(in calculating the peak cross section the correlation of the fit-errors is considered in first order error propagation).
The resonance curve was fitted to the measured data using a least-squares fit and the resulting parameters are summarized in table \korr{REF}.
The measured data and fits is depicted in figure \ref{fig:cross_section_fit}.
\korr{discuss deviation in electron channel (esp. mass)}


\begin{figure}[tb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics{./figures/cross_sections.pdf}
	\caption{bla}
	\label{fig:cross_section_fit}
\end{figure}

\begin{table}
	\centering
	\input{./tables/fit_params.tex}
	\caption{Fit Params}
\end{table}

Using the error weighted mean
\begin{align*}
	&\bar{x} = \frac{\sum_i w_i x_i}{\sum_i w_i} \qquad \sigma_{\bar{x}} = \frac{1}{\sum_i w_i}\\
	&w_i = \frac{1}{\sigma_i^2} 	
\end{align*}
with weights $w_i$ given by the standard deviation the mean values of the Z-mass and decay width can be determined to be
\begin{align*}
	M_\mathrm{Z} &= \SI{91.15 +- 0.10}{GeV}\\
	\Gamma_\mathrm{Z} &= \SI{2.52 +- 0.02}{GeV} 
\end{align*}
The comparison of the Z-mass with the literature value \cite{pdg}
\begin{align*}
	M_\mathrm{Z}^\mathrm{PDG} = \SI{91.1876 +- 0.0021}{GeV}
\end{align*}
shows agreement within the errors of the measured value.
The full decay width shows a deviation of a bit more than $1\sigma$ from the literature value \cite{pdg}
\begin{align*}
	\Gamma_\mathrm{Z}^\mathrm{PDG} = \SI{2.4952 +- 0.0023}{GeV}
\end{align*}
This is due to the large deviation of the full decay width in the tau-channel, which is probably caused by additional misidentified events that could not be corrected using the efficiency matrix formalism.
This is because classification of tau events is difficult.

\subsubsection{Confidence Levels}
\begin{table}
	\centering
	\input{./tables/chisqr.tex}
	\caption{chisquare stuff}
\end{table}

\begin{align*}
	p(\chi^2, \mathrm{ndf}) = \int_{\chi^2}^\infty f(x, \mathrm{ndf}) \dinf{x}
\end{align*}
with the probability density~$f(x, \mathrm{ndf})$ of the $\chi^2$-distribution with $\mathrm{ndf}$ degrees of freedom.


\subsubsection{Calculation of the Partial Widths}
According to
\begin{align*}
	\sigma_f^\mathrm{peak} = \frac{12 \pi}{M_\mathrm{Z}^2} \cdot \frac{\Gamma_\mathrm{e}}{\Gamma_\mathrm{Z}} \cdot \frac{\Gamma_f}{\Gamma_\mathrm{Z}} 
\end{align*}
the partial decay widths $\Gamma_f$ can be extracted from the fitted peak cross section.
For the calculation of the partial width the averaged values for the Z-mass and the full decay width of the Z-boson, which were determined in section \ref{sec:fit_resonance} are used.
First the partial width in the electron channel can be determined according to
\begin{align*}
	\Gamma_\mathrm{e} = \sqrt{\frac{M_\mathrm{Z}^2}{12 \pi} \, \Gamma_\mathrm{Z}^2 \sigma_\mathrm{e}^\mathrm{peak}}
\end{align*}
this partial width can then be used to determine the remaining partial widths $f \in \{ \mathrm{\mu}, \mathrm{\tau}, \mathrm{hadrons} \}$ using
\begin{align*}
	\Gamma_f = \frac{M_\mathrm{Z}^2}{12 \pi } \, \frac{\Gamma_\mathrm{Z}^2 }{\Gamma_\mathrm{e}} \sigma_f^\mathrm{peak}
\end{align*}
Again using gaussian error propagation one gets
\begin{alignat*}{2}
	&\Gamma_\mathrm{e} = \SI{83.6 +- 1.8}{MeV} \qquad
	&&\Gamma_\mathrm{\mu} = \SI{85.0 +- 2.3}{MeV}\\
	&\Gamma_\mathrm{\tau} = \SI{87.1 +- 3.5}{MeV}\qquad
	&&\Gamma_\mathrm{hadrons} = \SI{1778.5 +- 39}{MeV}
\end{alignat*}
Comparison with literature \cite{pdg}
\begin{align*}
	&\Gamma_\ell = \SI{83.984 +- 0.086}{MeV} \\
	&\Gamma_\mathrm{hadrons} = \SI{1744.4 +- 2.0}{MeV}
\end{align*}
\korr{again deviation in tau}

\subsubsection{Lepton Universality}
According to lepton universality one would expect the same peak cross sections and partial widths for all lepton final states.
A test of lepton universality is then
\begin{align*}
	&\frac{\Gamma_\mathrm{\mu}}{\Gamma_\mathrm{e}} = \frac{\sigma_\mathrm{\mu}^\mathrm{peak}}{\sigma_\mathrm{e}^\mathrm{peak}} = \num{1.017 +- 0.044}\\
	&\frac{\Gamma_\mathrm{\tau}}{\Gamma_\mathrm{e}} = \frac{\sigma_\mathrm{\tau}^\mathrm{peak}}{\sigma_\mathrm{e}^\mathrm{peak}} = \num{1.042 +- 0.055}\\
\end{align*}
(the mean values as well as the errors comparing partial widths and peak cross sections are the same if the correlation of the errors is considered).
One can see that both values are consistent with one so that lepton violation is not falsified.
These values can be compared with \cite{pdg}
\begin{align*}
	&\left(\frac{\Gamma_\mathrm{\mu}}{\Gamma_\mathrm{e}}\right)^\mathrm{PDG} = \num{1.0009 +- 0.0028} \\
	&\left(\frac{\Gamma_\mathrm{\tau}}{\Gamma_\mathrm{e}}\right)^\mathrm{PDG} = \num{1.0019 +- 0.0032} \\
\end{align*}
which also shows good agreement with the data measured at OPAL. 


\subsubsection{Number of Light Neutrino Generations}
From the expression of the full decay width of the Z-boson
\begin{align*}
	\Gamma_\mathrm{full} = \Gamma_\mathrm{e} + \Gamma_\mathrm{\mu} + \Gamma_\mathrm{\tau} + N_\nu \Gamma_\mathrm{\nu} + \Gamma_\mathrm{hadrons} 
\end{align*}
with the number of light neutrino generations $N_\mathrm{\nu}$ (i.e.\ neutrinos with masses smaller than $M_\mathrm{Z} / 2$ \korr{is this correct?}) and the partial widths of the corresponding decay channel.
If we assume that the decay widths of the neutrino channel $\Gamma_\mathrm{\nu}$ is known from theory to be
\begin{align*}
	\Gamma_\mathrm{\nu} = \SI{167.6}{MeV}
\end{align*}
\korr{REF, Z0 Anleitung} the number of light neutrino generations can be calculated by
\begin{align*}
	N_\nu = \frac{\Gamma_\mathrm{full} - \Gamma_\mathrm{e} - \Gamma_\mathrm{\mu} - \Gamma_\mathrm{\tau} - \Gamma_\mathrm{hadrons}}{\Gamma_\nu}
\end{align*}
using the measured values for the remaining decay widths.
For \korr{...} the number of light neutrino generations of
\begin{align*}
	N_\mathrm{\nu} = \num{2.94 +- 0.24}
\end{align*}
is obtained.
The calculated value is consistent with the observed three light neutrino generations.

\subsubsection{Discussion of Uncertainties}
