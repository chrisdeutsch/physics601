\section{Introduction}



\section{Theoretical Background}

In the following chapter a brief overview of the knowledge needed to perform the lab experiment will be presented.

\subsection{Standard Model of Elementary Particle Physics}

The Standard Model describes the elementary particles and their interactions, excluding gravitation.
In the Standard Model particles can be grouped by their properties into quarks, leptons and interaction particles.
While quarks and leptons are fermions, the interaction particles are (gauge) bosons.
Quarks have fractional charge of $+2/3$ or $-1/3$ and leptons are either charged (with charge $\pm1$ for electron, muon and tau) or uncharged (neutrinos).
Interaction particles can also be charged (W~boson) or uncharged (photon, gluon, Z~boson).

\end{figure}

\subsection{Heavy Vector Boson Z$^0$}

The particle of interest for this experiment is the Z~boson \korr{dessen} decays are studied.
The Z~boson has a mass of \SI{91.2}{GeV} and a decay width of \SI{2.5}{GeV}.
It was discovered in 1983 in collider experiments at CERN.

\subsubsection{Decays of Z$^0$}

Z~bosons can decay in many different ways.
The final state of their decays can contain quarks, charged leptons and neutrinos, although it must be noted, that the top quark can not be produced since it is way heavier than the Z~boson.
Due to conservation laws the Z~boson may produce only pairs of particles and antiparticles (e.g. electron and positron or neutrino and corresponding antineutrino).
In case of production of a quark-antiquark pair the final state particles will form jets.
Because of confinement in QCD the strong interaction becomes stronger for larger distances between two strongly interacting particles.
If quark and antiquark fly apart a QCD field with high energy is created between them, where additional quark-antiquark pairs can be produced.
This process repeats itself as long as the particles have more energy than needed for formation of colourless hadrons.
As a result a hadronic decay of Z~bosons leads to a high number of final state particles, called jets.
Possible Feynman diagrams for the mentioned processes are shown in figure \korr{REF}.

\subsubsection{Forward-Backward Asymmetry A$_\mathrm{FB}$}

In a $e^+e^- \rightarrow f\bar{f}$ reaction the differential cross section of the produced fermions is different for the forward and backward hemispheres.
Those are defined by the angle $\theta$ between incoming positron and outgoing positively charged particle.
In this lab experiment, the asymmetry A$_\mathrm{FB}$ is measured in $e^+e^- \rightarrow \mu^+\mu^-$ events.

\subsection{The OPAL Experiment}

The OPAL~detector was used from 1989 to 2000 at the LEP storage ring at the CERN facility in Switzerland.
It was designed to detect all kinds of particles produced in collisions of electrons and positrons.
To cover most of the solid angle it had a barrel-like structure and consisted of a cylinder and two endcaps.
For tracking and vertex reconstruction purposes the inner part is formed by a semiconductor strip detector and multiple proportional chambers.
To measure the momentum of charged particles, the whole inner detector is surrounded by a solenoid which created a magnetic field.
The solenoid is followed by the calorimeters, first the electromagnetic and after that the hadronic one.
As a last layer muon chambers are installed which consist of a tracking detector themselves.

\section{Part I: Analysis of Event Displays}

On the first day the software \texttt{GROPE} was used to study event displays and detector responses of the OPAL detector.

\subsection{Part I: Analysis of Event Displays}

To learn how to distinguish the different decay channels of the Z boson test samples with events with only one decay mode have been investigated.
In the following part the measured properties of the observed events and exemplary pictures of the detector response are presented.

\subsubsection{Z$^0\rightarrow e^+e^-$}

A decay into electrons can easily be identified by the energy deposited in the electromagnetic calorimeters.
The final state particles are flying approximately in opposite direction and are ideally completely stopped in the calorimeter.
A track for every particle can be observed in the tracking chamber.
Additional hits in the electromagnetic calorimeters probably occur due to bremsstrahlung photons which leave no track in the inner detector.

	\input{./tables/tag1/ee}
	\caption{Collected data from the electron dataset. All values for energies and momenta in \si{GeV}.}
\end{sidewaystable}

\subsubsection{Z$^0\rightarrow \mu^+\mu^-$}

Muons are detected in the muon chambers which form the outermost part of the detector.
Since all other particles (except the non-detectable neutrinos) are stopped before reaching the muon chamber a signal there can -- neglecting noise hits -- be identified as a muon. 
In general, muons are also created in a back to back configuration and leave a track in the tracking detector.

	\centering

	\input{./tables/tag1/mm}
	\caption{Collected data from the muon dataset. All values for energies and momenta in \si{GeV}.}
\end{sidewaystable}

\subsubsection{Z$^0\rightarrow \tau^+\tau^-$}

Because of the short lifetime of the $\tau$ lepton it can not be detected directly but by its decay products.
Because it can decay in both leptons and hadrons there are two possible types of detector responses.
In a leptonic $\tau$ decay an electron or muon and two neutrinos are created and seen as charged tracks in the inner detector.
They cause signals either in the electromagnetic calorimeter or in the muon chambers while the neutrinos are not detected.

In a hadronic $\tau$ decay a neutrino and hadrons are produced.
All hadrons create a shower in the hadronic calorimeter but depending on their charge a track can not always be observed.

	\resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{
		\input{./tables/tag1/tt}
	}
	\caption{Collected data from the tau dataset. All values for energies and momenta in \si{GeV}.}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Z$^0\rightarrow q\bar{q}$}

Decays of Z$^0$ into quark-antiquark pairs always produce jets where quarks hadronize to mesons or baryons.
Those can be identified as a large number of charged tracks in the tracking system.
In addition some of the hadrons decay into leptons which can be seen as signal in the electromagnetic calorimeter or the muon chambers.
The hadrons are stopped and seen as showers in the hadronic calorimeter.

		\input{./tables/tag1/qq}
	}
	\caption{Collected data from the hadronic dataset. All values for energies and momenta in \si{GeV}.}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Event Identification in Test Sample}

Based on the observations from the previous exercise it was possible to evaluate cuts to apply on the data in order to distinguish between different decay channels of the Z boson.
The used cuts are given in table \ref{tab:cut_criteria_day1} and could be reviewed by looking on the events in a test sample.
All of the decay channels found with the cut criteria could be verified by analysis of event displays.

\end{table}

\clearpage
\section{Part II: Statistical Analysis of $\mathrm{Z}^0$ Decays}
The second part of this laboratory experiment is concerned with the analysis of data gathered by the OPAL-detector at LEP.
Since an analysis using event displays is infeasible, the data analysis software \texttt{PAW} is used instead.

\subsection{Analysis of Monte-Carlo Data}
Before the data taken at the OPAL-detector can be evaluated, four datasets of Monte-Carlo data are analyzed to refine the preliminary cuts that were determined in section \korr{REF}.
These datasets contain a selection of simulated $\mathrm{Z}^0$ decays, which are separated into the different decay channels with electron, muon, tau or hadronic final states.
Since the number of simulated events is known, these datasets can be used to estimate the (mis-)identification probability of our final cuts.



\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
	\begin{tabularx}{0.9\textwidth}{lX}
		\toprule
		\textbf{Variable} & \textbf{Description} \\
		\midrule		
		\texttt{ncharged} & Number of charged particle tracks in the tracking detector \\
		\texttt{pcharged} & Total momentum of all charged particle tracks in the tracking detector \\
		\texttt{e\_ecal} & Total energy deposited in the electromagnetic calorimeter \\
		\texttt{e\_hcal} & Total energy deposited in the hadronic calorimeter \\
		\texttt{cos\_thet} & Angle between the incoming positron and outgoing positively charged particle (undefined if the number of positively charged particles in the final state is not equal to one) \\
		\bottomrule
	\end{tabularx}
	\caption{Description of the variables in the $\mathrm{Z}^0$ decay datasets.}
	\label{tab:desc_variables}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Acceptance of the OPAL-Detector}
To get accustomed to the data analysis software the distributions of a number of variables in the MC data were plotted as histograms (a short description of the different variables can be found in table \ref{tab:desc_variables}).
One such variable is the sum of the charged particle momenta, which is depicted in figure \ref{fig:uncut_pcharged}.
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{./data/tag2/uncut/cropped/pcharged_uncut.pdf}
	\caption{Distribution of \texttt{pcharged} for the Monte-Carlo simulations of electron (upper left), muon (upper right), tau (lower left) and hadronic final states (lower right).}
	\label{fig:uncut_pcharged}
\end{figure}
A notable feature of these distributions is the high number of events with vanishing \texttt{pcharged} for the electron and muon channel, which shall be analyzed further.
To investigate this occurrence additional cuts on other variables were performed, which lead to the observation that these events stem from particles that have been detected at very small angles with respect to the beam axis.
Since the detector cannot properly detect particles close to the beam axis a cut on \texttt{cos\_thet} should decrease the number events with vanishing \texttt{pcharged}.
For this the cut
\begin{align*}
	|\cos\theta| < 0.9
\end{align*}
was chosen, which removed almost all events with vanishing \texttt{pcharged}.


\subsubsection{Refining the Cuts for Event Selection}
In order to optimize the cuts for event identification various variables of the simulated datasets have been plotted to allow for the determination of cut criteria to allow for the distinction of different decay channels of the Z-boson.
The histograms of the variables are depicted in appendix \ref{app:uncut_mc}.


Based on the observed distributions, cuts on the parameters have been set such that we can determine the decay channel in good approximation by cutting the data.
The resulting histograms are shown in figures \korr{REF} where one cut for identifying one decay channel has been applied to all datasets in each figure.
\korr{FIGURES}
While retaining as much events as possible it was not possible to fully differentiate between the decay channels.
Because of this, there are some misinterpreted events for datasets which do not correspond to the applied cuts.
For identifying electrons an additional cut on the angle was set such that only s-channel electrons are selected.
An overview of the cuts is given in table \ref{tab:cut_criteria}.
\begin{table}[h]
	\centering
	\input{./tables/cuts}
	\caption{Applied cuts on the data to identify the decay channel. An additional cut on the angle is used for electrons since only the s-channel is of interest.}
	\label{tab:cut_criteria}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Separating $s$- and $t$-Channel of Electron Final States}


\subsubsection{Efficiency Matrix}

Obviously one loses events in setting cuts on the data which makes it necessary to analyse the efficiency, i.e. the fractional losses of these cuts.
Knowing that each of the datasets have been simulated with \num{100000} events the efficiency can be calculated from the number of remaining events that fulfill the cut conditions.
A matrix formalism can be used to describe the number of measured events per decay channel $\vec{N}_\mathrm{meas}=(e_\mathrm{meas}, \mu_\mathrm{meas}, \tau_\mathrm{meas}, q_\mathrm{meas})^T$ by the number of events that have been simulated in this channel $\vec{N}_\mathrm{orig}$:
\begin{align}
\vec{N}_\mathrm{meas} = A \cdot \vec{N}_\mathrm{orig}
\end{align}
The values of $A$ describe how many events of one decay channel are identified as such or as one of the other decay channels.
With the measured event numbers after applying the cuts on all datasets, $A$ is then given by
\begin{align}
A = \begin{pmatrix}
	x & \dots \\
	\vdots & \ddots \\
	\end{pmatrix}
\end{align}

\subsection{Stuff}

Correction for missing s-channel electrons:
\begin{align*}
\frac{\int_{-1}^{1}(1 + \cos^2\theta) \dinf{\cos\theta}}{\int_{-0.9}^{0.5}(1 + \cos^2\theta) \dinf{\cos\theta}} = 1.5829
\end{align*}


Variance of the binomial distribution:
\begin{align*}
	\mathrm{Var} = n p (1 - p) 
\end{align*}


Calculation of the cross section
\begin{align*}
	N &= \sigma \cdot \int \mathcal{L} \dinf{t}\\
	\sigma &= \frac{N}{\int \mathcal{L} \dinf{t}}
\end{align*}
